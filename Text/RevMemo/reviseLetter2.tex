$\hspace{-5mm}$Dear Professor Dorussen, \\ [1ex]

We first would like to thank you for this second opportunity to revise and resubmit our manuscript. We believe the manuscript has greatly benefitted from the Reviewers' helpful and thoughtful comments, initially. We have revised the manuscript, taking seriously each individual point raised by the Reviewers. We have also added a short footnote adding some linkages to other articles in the volume. \\ [1ex]

Reviewer Two had only one relevant comment in this round, and we have made sure that Figure six has appropriate labels.\\ [1ex]

Review One raises two issues. First, this reviewer doesn't think the properties of the model are sufficiently transparent. Second, the reviewer wants to see this model run in a horse race against other similar approaches.\\ [1ex]

First, we are perplexed.  The model is designed to have the properties of a standard regression, which are pretty well known.  It is a type of vector autoregression that permits endogeneity as well as over time covariance structures. We have tried to explain this sufficiently, but are not sure what else would help.  On the second point, there are no similar other methods that allow temporal analysis of multiplex networks that we are aware of.  Comparing this to something noncomparable is not a useful endeavor. We do have some analyses of additive versus multiplicative underlying models, but that is rather an esoteric difference, and we are not sure that this would satisfy the horse race criterion.  As such we have left this aside for future endeavors.\\ [1ex]

We hope you agree that the manuscript has improved through this helpful process and we are looking forward to seeing this in print.\\ [1ex]

Merry Christmas, \\ [1ex]

The Authors.
