@article{erikson:etal:2014,
	Abstract = {International relations scholars frequently rely on data sets with
	country pairs, or dyads, as the unit of analysis. Dyadic data, with
	its thousands and sometimes hundreds of thousands of observations,
	may seem ideal for hypothesis testing. However, dyadic observations
	are not independent events. Failure to account for this dependence
	in the data dramatically understates the size of standard errors
	and overstates the power of hypothesis tests. We illustrate this
	problem by analyzing a central proposition among IR scholars, the
	democratic trade hypothesis, which claims that democracies seek out
	other democracies as trading partners. We employ randomization tests
	to infer the correct p-values associated with the trade hypotheses.
	Our results show that typical statistical tests for significance
	are severely overconfident when applied to dyadic data.},

@article{ward:hoff:2007,
	Abstract = {The authors examine a standard gravity model of international commerce
	augmented to include political as well as institutional influences
	on bilateral trade. Using annual data from 1980-2001, they estimate
	regression coefficients and residual dependencies using a hierarchy
	of models in each year. Rather than gauge the generalizability of
	these patterns via traditional measures of statistical significance
	such as p-values, this article develops and employs a strategy to
	evaluate the out-of-sample predictive strength of various models.
	The analysis of recent international commerce shows that in addition
	to a typical gravity-model specification, political and institutional
	variables are important. The article also demonstrates that the often-reported
	link between international conflict and bilateral trade is elusive,
	and that inclusion of conflict in a trade model can sometimes lead
	to reduced out-of-sample predictive performance. Further, this article
	illustrates that there are substantial, persistent residual exporter-
	and importer-specific effects, and that ignoring such patterns in
