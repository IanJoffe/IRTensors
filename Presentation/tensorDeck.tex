  \frametitle{Model Specification}
  \vspace{-5mm}
  \begin{itemize}
  \item Dependent variables: Log(Exports) and Stdzed(Material Conflict). 
  \item Direct ($i$), reciprocal ($ji$) and transitive ($ijk$) 1 month lags of these included as IVs.
  \item Exogenous Covariates:
    \begin{itemize}
    \item Number of Preferential Trade Agreements (PTA) between $i$ and $j$ (this is an undirected, yearly level variable). Direct and transitive version of this variable included as covariates.
    \item Presence of a defensive alliance relationship between $i$ and $j$ (undirected, yearly level). Direct and transitive versions.
    \item Centroid distance between $i$ and $j$ (directed). Direct version.
    \item Polity, monthly level variable. Polity of sender included.
    \item Log(GDP), yearly level variable but imputed at the monthly level. GDP of sender.
    \item Log(Population), yearly level variable but imputed at the monthly level. Population of sender.
    \item Log(Total Exports to any country), monthly level variable. Exports of sender.
    \end{itemize}

  \frametitle{Question}
  \begin{itemize}
  \item Advances in computerized coding have enabled us to develop large datasets of state interactions at low levels of temporal aggregation
  \item How can we leverage this information to generate meaningful measures of how states relate to one another

  \frametitle{Sample \& Data}
  \begin{itemize}

  \frametitle{Modeling Approach}
  \begin{itemize}
  \item Multilinear tensor regression framework
  \item MCMC run for 1300 iterations with first 600 used as burn-in\footnote{Using this many datapoints takes time the MCMC will keep running for another 3700 iterations so these results are preliminary, but trace plots at the end of this pdf look stable after 600 iterations}

  \frametitle{Modeling Approach}
  \begin{itemize}
  \item We estimate our model over three separate time periods to develop a measure of state interest that varies over time: 2001-2005, 2006-2010, 2011-2014
>>>>>>> origin/master
  \item The model has the following form:
  \begin{align*}
  \textbf{Y} = \textbf{X} \times \{\boldsymbol{\beta_{1}}, \boldsymbol{\beta_{2}}, \boldsymbol{\beta_{3}} \} + \textbf{E}
  \end{align*}
<<<<<<< HEAD
  \item \textbf{Y} is a $161 \times 161 \times 2 \times 165$ array
  \item \textbf{X} is a $161 \times 161 \times 13 \times 165$ array, where each of the 13 variables is lagged by one month
=======
  \item \textbf{Y} is a $50 \times 50 \times 4 \times t$ array, where $t$ is equal to the number of months within each period
  \item \textbf{X} is a $50 \times 50 \times 12 \times t$ array, where each of the 12 variables is lagged by one month

  \frametitle{Performance Comparisons: MLTR \& DD}

\begin{itemize}
\item Across all cases the R$^{2}$ is higher using the MLTR approach for both exports (95\% v. 89\%) and matl. conf. (28\% v. 26\%)
\item MLTR has a lower RMSE in $\approx$ 57\% of cases for Log(Exports)
\item MLTR has a lower RMSE in $\approx$ 80\% of cases for Std(Matl. Conf.)
\item Across all cases the RMSE is lower using the MLTR approach for both exports (2.32 v. 2.37) and matl. conf. (0.85 v. 0.86)
\item However, as shown by the aggregate RMSE statistics right above, the differences in performance are small
\item Additionally, in the next two slides I break out the performance, in terms of RMSE, by showing the results for OECD--OECD and Not OECD--Not OECD countries
